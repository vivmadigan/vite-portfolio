                    Who is <strong>Viv Madigan</strong>?
                </h1>
                <p>Hi! My name is Vivyan Madigan, and I'm currently studying .NET development at Nackademin in Stockholm. My program spans both backend and frontend development and will conclude in June 2026. Originally from Australia, I relocated to Stockholm in 2020, where I transitioned from a decade-long career in the film industry to pursuing my passion for technology and problem-solving.</p>
                <p>Before diving into software development, I honed my skills as a cinematographer and camera assistant, roles that demanded creativity, precision, and collaboration. My move to Sweden brought exciting new challenges, including learning Swedish, which I studied intensively at Komvux and Stockholm University. This adaptability and willingness to grow have fueled my journey into programming.</p>
                <p>I'm currently seeking a LIA placement from November 2025 to May 2026 to expand my professional experience and contribute to meaningful projects. If my mix of technical skills, creativity, and determination sounds like a good match, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
                <p>If you want to check out my portfolio click on the button just bellow or scroll down to find out more about my film work and hobbies.</p>

                <h4>Film Work</h4>
                <p>I spent over a decade in the Australian film industry, working on a wide range of projects as both a camera assistant and cinematographer. From independent short films and award-winning web series to documentaries and TV productions, I honed my craft by collaborating with diverse teams and navigating the technical and creative demands of visual storytelling. My work on projects like Wastelander Panda and Wolf Creek sharpened my ability to perform under pressure and adapt to complex challengesâ€”skills that now enrich my approach to problem-solving in software development.

                <h4>Photography</h4>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy photography, especially capturing natural, unposed moments that tell a story. I love hiking and camping, where I get to explore beautiful landscapes and document them through my lens. For me, photography is about preserving the raw beauty of the world and the emotions it evokes.</p>
